### Overview
SHOPBYAISLE : Yes, you heard it right!! ShopByAisle Web Application is what I Intend to work upon to make shopping experience for users like me, a speedy process.

It is about creating a shopping list by the user, which not only helps to prepare and maintain a list of frequently shopped items from his favorite nearby stores but also helps to locate the items in the store by aisle. Basically, this application is not store specific and will use user inputs for aisle locations of items in nearby Stores.Also, aisle information could be shared across users.

I came up with this idea in today’s situation of Covid-19. Due to my health restrictions, my husband who is a rare shopper started to shop frequently. Seeing the amount of time he spent searching the items in stores and shopping, I really wished there was an app where he had my shopping list along with the aisles mentioned next to it to make his shopping experience hassle free and faster to navigate in stores. That’s when I got this idea to create an application to make things easy for both of us.

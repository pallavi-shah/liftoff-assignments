### Overview
SHOPBYAISLE : Yes, you heard it right!! ShopByAisle Mobile Web Application is what I Intend to work upon to make shopping experience for users like me, a speedy process.

The application stores list of items to be shopped and their aisle location in stores. The aisle information is provided by users only and then shared with other users/shoppers, revealing the power of crowd-sourcing. The app also provides for store search functionality which will let users search their nearby stores and add them to their favorite stores list for the purpose of creating shopping list and managing aisle information. 

I came up with this idea in today’s situation of Covid-19. Due to my health restrictions, my husband who is a rare shopper started to shop frequently. Seeing the amount of time he spent searching the items in stores and shopping, I really wished there was an app where he had my shopping list along with the aisles mentioned next to it to make his shopping experience hassle free and faster to navigate in stores. That’s when I got this idea to create an application to make things easy for both of us.
